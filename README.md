# SuperMarioGame
I created a super Mario using Assembly language. The game consists of 3 levels with increase difficulty in each level. The game is MASM compatible. The syntax of MASM is little different than NASM, it is not compatible with NASM supported assembler. Can be compiled and played using DOSBox(can be downloaded from here https://www.dosbox.com/) or any other
masm supported assembler.
